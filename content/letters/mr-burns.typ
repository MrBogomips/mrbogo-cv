Dear Mr. Burns,

I am writing to express my interest in the unpaid internship position at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. As the son of one of your most dedicated employees, Homer Simpson (Sector 7-G), I believe I have unique insights into your organization's... relaxed operational standards.

My qualifications make me an ideal candidate for this role:

*Chaos Management Experience:* I have successfully managed chaos in various environments, from the cafeteria at Springfield Elementary to the streets of Springfield during multiple town-wide emergencies. This experience has prepared me to handle the day-to-day operations at your facility.

*Problem-Solving Skills:* When faced with challenges, I think outside the box. For instance, when conventional methods failed, I pioneered the "deny everything" approach, which I believe could be valuable during any future NRC inspections.

*Family Connection:* My father's 20+ years of service (despite numerous safety violations) demonstrates our family's commitment to your organization. I am eager to continue this legacy, preferably in a position with more snack access than his.

*Relevant Projects:* My discovery of Comet Bart demonstrates my ability to notice things others miss, a skill that could prove useful in identifying minor issues like glowing barrels or three-eyed fish before they become PR problems.

I understand the plant has faced certain... challenges with public perception. As someone who has successfully maintained the secret identity of "El Barto" for years despite intense scrutiny, I am well-versed in reputation management.

I am available to start immediately after school hours and during detentions (which I am told I can serve remotely). I am flexible on compensation, though unlimited access to the vending machines would be appreciated.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to Springfield Nuclear's continued success, or at minimum, its continued operation.

Respectfully submitted,

Bart Simpson

P.S. - If this application is unsuccessful, please note that I know where the release button for the hounds is located.
