Dear Mr. Burns,

I am writing to express my interest in the unpaid internship position at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. As the son of one of your most dedicated employees, Homer Simpson (Sector 7-G), I believe I have unique insights into your organization's operational culture.

My qualifications include:

*Chaos Management:* I have successfully managed chaos in various environments, from the cafeteria at Springfield Elementary to town-wide emergencies. This experience has prepared me to handle day-to-day operations at your facility.

*Problem-Solving:* When conventional methods fail, I pioneered the "deny everything" approach, which could prove valuable during future NRC inspections.

*Relevant Projects:* My discovery of Comet Bart demonstrates my ability to notice things others miss - useful for identifying minor issues like glowing barrels before they become PR problems.

I am available to start immediately after school hours. I am flexible on compensation, though unlimited vending machine access would be appreciated.

Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully submitted,

Bart Simpson

P.S. - If unsuccessful, please note that I know where the hounds' release button is located.
