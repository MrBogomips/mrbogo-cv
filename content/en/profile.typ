#let about-me = [
  I am Springfield Elementary's most dedicated detention attendee and founder of the "I Didn't Do It" defense strategy. I specialize in creative problem-solving, particularly when the problem is boredom.

  Currently exploring career opportunities that leverage my extensive experience in chaos management and authority figure evasion.

#let intro-text = [
I am a fourth-grade student at Springfield Elementary School with a passion for skateboarding, pranks, and pushing boundaries. My motto, "Eat my shorts," reflects my commitment to authentic self-expression in a world that values conformity.

I bring years of experience in classroom disruption, creative excuse generation, and interpersonal conflict resolution (with my sister Lisa). I have successfully avoided responsibility across multiple domains while maintaining strong relationships with my best friend Milhouse.

I am seeking opportunities that value innovation, risk-taking, and thinking outside the box (especially when that box is a classroom). I work best in environments with minimal supervision and maximum snack availability.
